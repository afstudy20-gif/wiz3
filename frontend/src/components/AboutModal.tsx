const CHANGELOG = [
  { ver: "1.9.16", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "RCS Dose-Response and Cox-RCS (multivariable) moved out of the Regression sub-tab into a new dedicated 'Restricted Cubic Spline' sub-tab next to Regression and Survival Advanced. The new panel keeps both model types (univariate RCS with logistic/linear/Cox outcome + multivariable Cox-RCS with 1-2 spline terms and optional RCS × RCS interaction) under one roof, with a model picker at the top. Cleaner separation of concerns: the Regression tab no longer mixes non-linear dose-response modelling with standard GLMs, and the new tab gives RCS workflows their own surface area without bloating ModelsPanel.tsx (now ~270 lines lighter). All run handlers, form state, and result renderers extracted into the new RCSPanel component." },
  { ver: "1.9.15", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Kaplan-Meier now supports 'Stratify by' in addition to 'Group by'. Selecting a stratification column runs a separate KM analysis (with its own group curves and log-rank test) for each unique value of that column, then renders the results as a responsive small-multiples grid — 1×2, 1×3, or 2×N depending on stratum count. Each panel is a self-contained Plotly chart with 95% CI bands, the stratum label, n, and a log-rank p badge. Enables the classic 'KM by LDL tercile, stratified by age group' workflow in a single click. Backend: KMRequest gains stratify_col; a new _km_fit_groups/_km_logrank helper pair avoids duplicating the fitting logic; response carries 'strata' array when stratify_col is set." },
  { ver: "1.9.14", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "RCS Dose-Response now supports spline × covariate interaction. New 'interaction_covariates' field on /api/models/rcs: each named covariate (dummy-encoded if categorical) multiplies every spline basis column (linear + cubic). Server then refits a reduced model without those columns and reports an LR test (χ², df = #interaction columns, p) so the user can test whether the dose-response shape differs across covariate levels — e.g. does the LDL curve differ by SEX? Frontend Covariates list grows a small ×spl checkbox next to each covariate that's ticked; selecting it adds the interaction. Result card shows the LR test in an amber chip when p < 0.05 with an actionable hint ('consider reporting stratified curves')." },
  { ver: "1.9.13", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Survival Advanced: 'Run' button looked like it did nothing when the user changed parameters after a first run. Every Run* handler (KM, Cox, Fine-Gray, E-value, Landmark) now wipes the previous result + error state at the very start so the panel visibly resets while the request is in flight. Also added useEffect param-watchers that auto-clear the stale result the moment a duration / event / predictor / interaction / group / landmark-time changes, so re-running with new parameters always reflects the new inputs. Other panels (Models, ROC, Hypothesis, PSM, Table 1) already had the reset-on-run pattern and were unaffected." },
  { ver: "1.9.12", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Cox Proportional Hazards now supports pairwise interaction terms. Backend /api/models/survival/cox accepts an interactions: [[A,B], ...] list and builds A:B columns post-encoding — numeric × numeric is the element-wise product, numeric × categorical expands across every dummy of the categorical, categorical × categorical multiplies every dummy pair. Each interaction shows up as its own row ('LDL:AGE', 'SEX_M:AGE', ...) in the coefficient table with HR, 95% CI, p. Frontend Cox panel: new 'Interactions' section appears once ≥2 predictors are ticked — two dropdowns + Add → amber chip 'LDL × AGE' with × to remove. Tip explains element-wise product, expansion, and DOF cost." },
  { ver: "1.9.11", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Cox Univariable scan UI: Turkish labels translated to English (Univariable Scan / Variable / Close / Add p<0.10 hint) and a tooltip on the button explains what the scan does — fits a separate Cox PH per predictor, ranks by p, points users at the p<0.10 cutoff with the SMOKER suppressor case as a worked example." },
  { ver: "1.9.10", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Cox Proportional Hazards endpoint (/api/models/survival/cox) now dummy-encodes categorical predictors (drop_first=True) just like the RCS endpoint does. Previously a Surv(time, event) ~ LDL + AGE + SEX + DM + HT + SMOKER fit would crash with 'could not convert string to float' as soon as the user ticked a categorical predictor; now SEX/DM/HT/SMOKER expand into binary dummies automatically." },
  { ver: "1.9.9", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "RCS covariate picker now lists ALL columns (numeric AND categorical) with a small N/C badge. Categorical covariates are dummy-coded server-side (drop_first=True) so the user can adjust for SEX, DM, HT, etc. directly without recoding. Result card now surfaces an 'Adjusted for: …' chip row with the per-covariate effect ratio (HR/OR for cox/logistic, β for linear) so the user can verify the model actually used what they ticked. n_total / n_excluded reported when rows are dropped. Univariate RCS allows only one spline term — for an LDL spline AND an AGE spline use the Cox-RCS multivariable panel and toggle interaction." },
  { ver: "1.9.8", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "PNG exports now include the chart title + caption + axis labels (was bare plot only). New TitledPlot wrapper exposes inline editable fields for Title / Subtitle / X axis / Y axis above every chart — edits are persisted per session and applied to the Plotly layout, so the PNG / SVG / PDF that gets downloaded carries exactly what's on screen. RCS dose-response and Cox-RCS HR surface migrated. PNG-export resolver hardened: searches the plot ref for the graph div via .el, the ref itself, .elRef.current, or a .plotly-graph-div query, and only triggers the download when Plotly has actually attached _fullLayout. Fixes 'PNG export failed: Cannot read properties of undefined'." },
  { ver: "1.9.7", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "RCS dose-response result now adapts to the selected outcome type: Cox runs render Hazard Ratio everywhere (axis title, hover, knot tooltips, export header, reference annotation, plain-English summary) and the panel title says 'Cox-RCS'; logistic stays Odds Ratio; linear shows Mean difference with a zero reference line and a linear y-axis. Was hardcoded to 'Odds Ratio' regardless of model_type so Cox fits looked like logistic." },
  { ver: "1.9.6", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Variable-kind dropdown audit. ROC Binary Outcome picker now narrows to detected 0/1 columns (was every column — could silently accept a continuous variable as the outcome). RCS Dose-Response Outcome picker now switches list by outcome type: Logistic = binary columns, Linear = numeric columns, Cox uses duration+event already. ICC tab now offers only numeric columns for Rater 1 / Rater 2 — Cohen's κ stays on all columns (categorical or binary). Inline amber warning when no binary column is detected, with a suggestion to recode in the Dictionary modal." },
  { ver: "1.9.5", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Cox-RCS interaction HR surface: 2D contour ★ / 3D surface toggle. The 3D view uses Plotly's surface trace with a log-z axis, interactive rotate/zoom camera, and projected contour lines on the floor — easier to read the joint dose-response landscape across LDL × AGE (or any rcs × rcs pair). 2D contour with isohypse lines remains the default and stays publication-ready. Event-column pickers in the Cox / Cox-RCS / RCS-Cox forms now narrow to binary 0/1 columns (with an inline warning when none are detected)." },
  { ver: "1.9.4", date: "2026-05-15", notes: "Refresh app button (mirrors the not.drtr.uk Notepad pattern). Unregisters every service-worker registration for this origin, deletes the Cache Storage entries, then hard-reloads with a ?_r=... cache-bust query so the HTTP cache is bypassed too. Available in the main app header (with a confirm prompt because a dataset may be open), in the splash 'About uSTAT' row, and in the Power Analysis sub-header. Pure client-side, origin-scoped — other sites untouched, server session unaffected." },
  { ver: "1.9.3", date: "2026-05-14", notes: "Splash now surfaces the other drtr.uk apps as a 5-tile row (Notepad, PDF Annotator, ECG Caliper, noedw, low) with icons and short descriptions. Tiles open in a new tab. Provides a single discovery surface across the drtr.uk app suite without leaving uSTAT." },
  { ver: "1.9.2", date: "2026-05-14", notes: "Independent-verifiability pass. Security page now ships a 'Verify our claims yourself' section with curl one-liners for headers, links to Mozilla Observatory + SecurityHeaders.com + Qualys SSL Labs + HSTS-Preload + VirusTotal, and a strace recipe for proving 'never writes the dataset to disk' against a local clone. Source-side line pointers added (store.py / upload.py / middleware / CI workflow). Domain-based contact emails: security@drtr.uk for disclosure and contact@drtr.uk for general — used in privacy.html, terms.html, security.html, About modal, and /.well-known/security.txt (env-overridable via SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL). Privacy clarification: MapMyVisitors widget explicitly NOT advertising — uSTAT never asks users to disable an ad-blocker." },
  { ver: "1.9.1", date: "2026-05-14", notes: "Hotfix: SecurityHeadersMiddleware crashed every request on production (MutableHeaders has no .pop). Clean URLs added: /privacy, /terms, /security 308-redirect to the static pages so the security.txt Policy: link and any external citation works without the .html suffix. About modal now opens with a prominent indigo Legal & Security quick-link row (Privacy · Terms · Security Overview · security.txt · Source). Splash footer carries the same links. Power tab removed from main tab strip (still reachable from the splash tile). Code tab no longer hidden when ENABLE_CODE_RUNNER is off — CodePanel shows an in-page disabled banner instead. MapMyVisitors widget now mounts only on the splash screen via useEffect and is torn down when the user opens a dataset." },
  { ver: "1.9.0", date: "2026-05-14", notes: "Security & transparency pass. Public Privacy Policy / Terms of Use / Security Overview pages (/privacy.html, /terms.html, /security.html). RFC 9116 /.well-known/security.txt for vulnerability disclosure. Browser-hardening middleware: HSTS one-year preload, CSP (report-only until tuned), X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, Referrer-Policy strict-origin, Permissions-Policy denying camera/mic/geo/etc., COOP same-origin. Continuous security scan workflow on every push (bandit, pip-audit, npm audit, semgrep OWASP, gitleaks). About modal clarifies server-side architecture, surfaces GitHub source link, adds Privacy/Terms/Security/security.txt deep-links and a browser-hygiene checklist." },
  { ver: "1.8.0", date: "2026-05-14", notes: "PSM panel — full feature parity with R MatchIt / twang. Alternative propensity-score models (logistic / probit / GBM). Optimal Hungarian matching (1:1) in addition to greedy NN — falls back to greedy when ratio > 1. Exact-match strata (treated and control must agree on selected categorical columns before NN). Survival outcome path: stratified Cox PH with strata = matched-set ID, returns HR + concordance. Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis for 1:1 binary outcomes — reports discordant pair counts, critical Γ at α=0.05, and the full Γ-vs-p curve up to a configurable Γmax." },
  { ver: "1.7.1", date: "2026-05-14", notes: "PSM panel hardened (Austin 2011 compliance): caliper now applied on logit-PS scale by default (raw still selectable); SMD denominator fixed to pooled SD of the unmatched sample so before/after deltas reflect only the numerator shift; added Rubin variance ratio and KS-test p-value per covariate; added Crump 2009 common-support trimming option; matching ratio 1:1–1:5 selector; random seed input for reproducible LR fits; balance flag now requires both SMD<0.10 and variance ratio in [0.5, 2.0]; treated units now processed by decreasing PS (greedy NN, hardest-first)." },
  { ver: "1.7.0", date: "2026-05-14", notes: "RCS Cox time-to-event outcome with custom knot positions (e.g. clinical 70/100/130/160 mg/dL as a sensitivity analysis to Harrell percentiles). New Cox-RCS multivariable model: 1 or 2 RCS terms + additive linear covariates + optional RCS × RCS interaction with LR test and 2D HR contour plot — supports the full Surv(time,event) ~ rcs(LDL,4) * rcs(AGE,4) + ... workflow. New Code tab: server-side Python sandbox (gated by ENABLE_CODE_RUNNER) with import allowlist, rlimits, optional network unshare, audit log, and per-session rate limit. df is auto-injected; matplotlib figures captured. Templates for the three canonical Cox-RCS analysis steps." },
  { ver: "1.6.0", date: "2026-05-05", notes: "About reorg: Validation status banner, Tests & Methods table mapping every test to its underlying SciPy/statsmodels/lifelines/scikit-learn function, creator credit. Splash Privacy/Scope/Cost tiles. SEO metadata: SoftwareApplication + WebSite JSON-LD, expanded keywords, canonical, OG locale. Fix: XLSX export (defensive xlsx module shape resolution + visible errors). Fix: Save Session — blob fetch + anchor download instead of iframe (no more SPA navigation away). Fix: privacy copy now reflects actual in-memory-only TTL behaviour. MapMyVisitors widget at 25% scale." },
  { ver: "1.5.0", date: "2026-04-04", notes: "Ctrl+V paste from Excel/CSV, insert column left/right, copy row/column to clipboard, proprietary license" },
  { ver: "1.4.0", date: "2026-04-03", notes: "Right-click context menu, row/column operations, fill blanks (mean/median/MICE), undo/redo, variable rename, decimal formatting" },
  { ver: "1.3.0", date: "2026-04-02", notes: "Model diagnostics, calibration, decision curve analysis, model comparison, bootstrap CI, permutation tests" },

              uSTAT is a <strong>server-side</strong> application: your file is sent to our backend, parsed in RAM, and bound to a session ID. It is <strong>never written to disk</strong> and is automatically discarded 30 minutes after your last activity (<code>SESSION_TTL_SECONDS = 1800</code> in <code>backend/services/store.py</code>). No account, no persistent identifiers, no logs of your data. Stack and code are <a href="https://github.com/afstudy20-gif/wiz3" className="text-indigo-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">public on GitHub</a> for independent review.
